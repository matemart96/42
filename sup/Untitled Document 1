       -fstype type
              File  is  on  a  filesystem  of type type.  The valid filesystem
              types vary among different versions of Unix; an incomplete  list
              of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or
              another is: ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.   You  can
              use  -printf  with  the  %F  directive  to see the types of your
              filesystems.
